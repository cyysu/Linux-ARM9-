<h1>Tracing tricks with ptrace</h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered how a program like the GNU debugger helps you peek 
into the working of another program? Have you thought of the magic which goes 
into a fascinating environment like UML (User Mode Linux)? It's the magic of 
`ptrace', one of the most interesting system calls available on GNU/Linux. The 
objective of this article is to present the systems programmer with sufficient 
information on the working of `ptrace' using which she can do cool projects like 
the design of a simple debugger on her own. 
</p><h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>The `ptrace' system call helps us temporarily stop a running process and read 
as well as modify the contents of registers and memory locations used by it. The 
traced program can be made to stop every time it tries to enter the kernel via a 
system call and every time it comes out of a syscall. We can also make the 
traced program stop itself after the execution of a single instruction. These 
features are enough to design debugging programs as well as sophisticated 
`virtualization' facilities like User Mode Linux. 
</p><p>Let's start with the code segment shown in <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list1.txt">Listing 1</a>. Try 
pressing `Ctrl-C' while the program is running. You will note that instead of 
getting terminated (which is the usual behaviour), the program gets `stopped'; 
executing `ps ax' shows that this is indeed the case. 
</p><p>The `ptrace' system call has the prototype: </p><pre>long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);

</pre>The first argument is a `request'. Here, we are using the macro 
PTRACE_TRACEME by which our program is conveying its readiness to get `traced'. 
The remaining three arguments are simply ignored if the request is 
PTRACE_TRACEME. Once the program has announced that it is ready to be traced, 
any signal delivered to it (with the exception of SIGKILL) will result in the 
process getting stopped. Pressing `Ctrl-C' results in a SIGINT signal being 
delivered to the process. 
<h2>Letting a parent trace its child</h2>
<p>Let's make things a bit more interesting. <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list2.txt">Listing 2</a> shows a 
program which calls the `fork' system call and creates a copy of itself. The 
child process invokes `execl' and runs the program `child1' which has been 
compiled from <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list3.txt">Listing 
3</a>. The program being exec'd keeps printing `hello' in an infinite loop after 
expressing its willingness to be traced. Now, the parent process sleeps for 1 
second and then sends the SIGINT signal to the child (using the `kill' system 
call). As a result, the child process stops and the parent comes out of `wait'; 
the WIFSTOPPED macro checks whether the variable `status' contains a bit pattern 
which indicates the fact that the child has stopped. The parent then goes to 
sleep for three more seconds; once it comes out of the sleep, it restarts the 
child by invoking `ptrace' with the request PTRACE_CONT. 
</p><p>The basic usage of `ptrace' can be summed up as follows: 
</p><ul>
  <li>Parent process forks and execs the child; the child should express its 
  willingness to be traced. 
  </li><li>Parent sends a signal to the child and waits for the child to stop. 
  </li><li>Once the child stops, the parent can manipulate it in different ways by 
  invoking `ptrace' with several different `requests'. 
  </li><li>When the parent has completed all `manipulations', it can restart the 
  child and let it run to completion (or maybe arrange things in such a way that 
  the child automatically stops at the next entry to a system call or stops 
  after doing just one instruction). </li></ul>
<p>Note that in this example, if the parent is to be able to trace the child, 
the child should have called `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...)'. If we are planning 
to write a debugger, we should be able to trace arbitrary processes and not just 
those who have expressed their willingness to be traced. <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list4.txt">Listing 4</a> shows a 
parent process which forks a child - the child immediately invokes the 
PTRACE_TRACEME request before loading `child2' (compiled from code in <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list5.txt">Listing 5</a>). The 
`ptrace' manual page says that an invocation of PTRACE_TRACEME will result in a 
signal SIGTRAP being delivered to the process every time an `exec' is called, 
even before the exec'd process gets a chance to run. As a result of getting this 
signal, the process stops. The parent then comes out of the wait, sleeps for ten 
seconds and restarts the exec'd process with an invocation of PTRACE_CONT. 
</p><h2>Parent peeks into child's registers!</h2>
<p><a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list6.txt">Listing 6</a> 
shows a parent which stops a child process, `child3', retrieves the values of 
all the CPU registers used by the child, alters the value of the `ebx' register 
and then let's the child continue its execution. The PTRACE_GETREGS request 
results in the values of the CPU registers used by the stopped child getting 
copied to a variable `uregs' of type `user_regs_struct'. If you read <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list7.txt">Listing 7</a>, you will 
see that the `ebx' register has the value 143 and the child keeps on looping 
until it becomes equal to 245. The parent simply displays the value of the `ebx' 
register (stored in the field uregs.ebx) and changes it to 245 by invoking 
PTRACE_SETREGS. The child is then restarted; it comes out of the loop because 
`ebx' has become 245. 
</p><h2>Parent peeks into child's memory!</h2>
<p>A tracing process can peek into the traced process's address space and 
extract the values of variables stored there. Say you wish to stop a process, 
examine the value of a variable `i' and change it to some other value. A 
fundamental problem is identifying the address of the variable. A trivial 
solution would be to make the process itself print it out or use an object file 
analysis tool like `nm'. A better way is to use the GNU BFD library. 
</p><p><a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list8.txt">Listing 8</a> 
shows a program which keeps on looping till a global variable `i' becomes equal 
to 245. Here is part of the output I got when I compiled the code into `child4' 
and executed `nm ./child4': </p><pre>080495a4 D _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_
         w __gmon_start__
080495c4 D i
08048278 T _init
080494c4 A __init_array_end

</pre>
<p>We see that the variable `i' has been assigned the address 0x80495c4. This 
address can be used by the code segment shown in <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list9.txt">Listing 9</a> to examine 
the value of `i' and alter it. The PTRACE_PEEKDATA parameter should be followed 
by the pid of the process being traced and the address of the location whose 
contents we wish to examine; in this case, it should be the address which `nm' 
has displayed. The PTRACE_POKEDATA request can be used to alter the contents of 
a memory location. 
</p><h2>Using the BFD library</h2>
<p>The GNU BFD (Binary File Descriptor) library can be used to extract 
information from binary files. At the moment, we are only interested in scanning 
an object file and identifying the names and addresses of all the globally 
visible symbols. <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list10.txt">Listing 10</a> is a 
program which does exactly this. It can be easily altered to yield the addresses 
of only those symbols we are interested in. 
</p><p>Each element of the array `symbol_table' contains a pointer to an object of 
type `asymbol'. The macro's `bfd_asymbol_name' and `bfd_asymbol_value' are used 
to extract the name of the symbol as well as its address. 
</p><h2>Single Stepping</h2>
<p>Debuggers help us `single-step' through our code, ie, execute one 
instruction, then stop and view value of some variable, execute one more 
instruction and so on. It's easy to do this using the PTRACE_SINGLESTEP request 
which restarts the stopped process, lets it execute a single instruction and 
then stops it once again. <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list11.txt">Listing 11</a> shows a 
segment of a tracing process which keeps on calling PTRACE_SINGLESTEP until 
value of a variable (at location `addr') in the traced program is found to 
become equal to 10. At this stage, the tracing program changes the value to 2341 
and lets the traced program run to completion by invoking PTRACE_CONT. <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list12.txt">Listing 12</a> shows 
the program being traced. 
</p><h2>System call tracing</h2>
<p>The Linux implementation of `ptrace' has the ability to trace system calls. 
The PTRACE_SYSCALL request restarts the child process (just like PTRACE_CONT) 
but arranges for it to stop at the next entry to or exit from a system call. 
This opens up some interesting possibilities. 
</p><p><a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list13.txt">Listing 13</a> 
shows a child process which first prints its own process id as well as its 
parent process id and then delivers a signal to itself. Because it is ready to 
be traced, this will result in the process getting stopped. The parent waits for 
this to happen and restarts the child by invoking PTRACE_SYSCALL. The next 
instruction in the child is an invocation of the `getpid' system call; the child 
gets stopped once again. Each system call has a unique `call number' - the 
operating system kernel uses this to identify the actual function to be 
executed. The parent process extracts this call number by invoking 
PTRACE_GETREGS (the `orig_eax' field of `ureg' holds the call number) and 
changes it to the call number of `getppid' by invoking PTRACE_SETREGS. The child 
is then restarted and allowed to run to completion by invoking PTRACE_CONT. 
Because the call number has been changed, the child will execute `getppid' 
instead of `getpid'! 
</p><p>This system call `redirection' has significance in the context of User Mode 
Linux (UML), which is a port of the Linux kernel to itself. UML allows you to 
run a modified version of the Linux kernel on top of the actual Linux kernel! 
You can run processes under the control of the modified kernel. When these 
processes execute system calls, they should execute code present in the modified 
kernel and not the original host kernel. This is achieved by using the 
PTRACE_SYSCALL facility offered by UML; interested readers should check out some 
of the papers available on the net which describe UML architecture. 
</p><h2>Attaching to a running process</h2>
<p>All the examples we had seen till now involved a parent process spawning a 
child and then tracing it. It is possible to use `ptrace' to trace an already 
running process which is not a proper child of the tracing program. 
</p><p><a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list14.txt">Listing 14</a> 
shows a tracing program calling PTRACE_ATTACH on a running process whose pid has 
been read from the keyboard - <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/list15.txt">Listing 15</a> shows 
the code of the process being traced. The tracing program has another input - 
the address of the function `fun' in the process being attached to. The effect 
of calling PTRACE_ATTACH is that the target becomes a `traced child' of the 
calling process; also, it appears as if the task being traced has called a 
PTRACE_TRACEME. A signal, SIGSTOP is delivered to it (as part of the 
PTRACE_ATTACH invocation) - the tracing program can now `wait' for the `child' 
to stop. Once the parent comes out of the wait, it examines the value of the 
instruction pointer in the child (the value stored in uregs.eip) and alters it 
to point to the function `fun'. The process is then restarted (note that there 
will be trouble if the function returns as we haven't stored a proper return 
address on the stack).
